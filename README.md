# Meteor Bootstrap
A starting point from which a meteor app may be developed.

### Instructions:
1. Change `"name": "<appName>"` in `package.json` to reflect the actual app's name.
2. Change all instances of `<appName>` in `upstart-init.conf` to reflect the actual app's name (description and cd).
3. Rename `upstart-init.conf` to a more sensible filename and move to `/etc/init/` (using Apache).
